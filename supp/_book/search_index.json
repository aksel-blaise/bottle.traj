Selden, Jr. 2022-11-01 Preface Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry In a June 18, 1937 WPA interview with Lillian Cassaway, Sadie Bedoka—a Caddo-Delaware woman who was raised wth the Caddo—states that: Each [Caddo] clan had its own shape to make its pottery. One clan never thought of making anything the same pattern of another clan. You could tell who made the pottery by the shape (Cassaway 1937, 395). Diagnostic types—whether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological (O’Brien and Lyman 1999)—are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations; however, the Caddo ceramic types are based primarily upon decorative motifs, and not morphology (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962). In recent analyses of Caddo bottle morphology (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019), vessels of the same decorative types (Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain) were found to differ in morphology when recovered from discrete geographical regions. Those studies were subsequently expanded to include a variety of Formative/Early and Late/Historic Caddo bottle types—from the same regions—to assess whether morphological differences identified in Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles extend to Caddo bottles generally, and whether those shapes differed through time (Selden Jr. 2021). More recently, morphological differences have been found to occur across the same geography for Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020a) and Perdiz arrow points, lending further support to the shape boundary hypothesis. This study enlists the largest corpus of Caddo bottles ever to be formally analysed, and assesses whether the trajectory of shape changes in Caddo bottles differs between river basins. Morphological disparity is subsequently used to assess within-basin diversity, eliciting evidence for technological innovation, growth, and maturity associated with Caddo bottle production. It is not known whether the same Caddo potter that manufactured these vessels also applied the decorative elements. However, if the same potter is assumed to have applied the motif, then it may be the case that Caddo vessel forms and decorative elements were intended to incorporate and communicate discrete cultural signals. Conceptually, these are conceived of as autogenous and adherent signals (sensu Kubler (1962)), where the autogenous signal is representative of vessel form (inclusive of shape and size), and the adherent signal, the motif (and decorative elements therein). 0.2 Hypotheses 0.2.1 Hypothesis 1 (Trajectory) Morphological trajectories of Caddo bottles differ by river basin through time. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/traj.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.1: Sites associated with the Caddo bottles used in the study denoting major river basins by colour. 0.2.2 Hypothesis 2 (Diversity) Morphological diversity is reflective of the technological life cycle (innovation, growth, or maturity). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/diversity.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.2: Conceptual rendering of how two trajectories may differ, illustrating higher/lower morphological diversity at different intervals. Basin 1 (blue) potentially reflects increased diversity through innovation (few makers), while the Basin 2 (orange) potentially reflects increased diversity through maturity (more makers). 0.3 Primary findings Hypothesis 1 (Trajectory) Hypothesis 2 (Diversity) 0.4 Acknowledgments RZS extends his gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for their guidance related to the development of the 3D scanning protocols, for permission and access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections, and for frank discussions related to language surrounding burial contexts associated with Caddo children. I extend my gratitude to the Material Sciences Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, the University Museum at the University of Arkansas, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions, access, and space needed to generate 3D scans of Caddo bottles.

Thulman for their constructive criticisms, comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research programme, as well as the editors and anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript. 0.5 Funding Development of the analytical work flow and production of 3D scans from the Turner and Webb collections was funded by a grant to the author (P14AP00138) from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training. Production of 3D scan data for Caddo bottles from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was funded by two Research Support Fund grants to the author from the Texas Archeological Society, and collection of 3D scan data for previously repatriated Caddo bottles was funded by a grant to the author from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. Funding to collect 3D scan data at the University Museum at the University of Arkansas was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University as well as a Data and Analytics grant and Residency to the author from the Spatial Archaeometry Research Collaborations through the University of Arkansas’ Center for Advanced Spatial Technology and Dartmouth’s Spatial Archaeometry Lab. 0.6 Data management The data and analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/GH7VZ). The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020b; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). 0.7 Colophon This version of the analysis was generated on 2022-11-01 14:49:41 using the following computational environment and dependencies: # what R packages and versions were used?

Adams et al. 2017; Dean C. Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). # gpa Y.gpa &lt;- gpagen(coords, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) # geomorph data frame gdf &lt;- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords, size = Y.gpa$Csize, geo = qdata$geo, time = qdata$time, comb = qdata$comb) # render 3d gpa plot #plot(Y.gpa) # gpa plot knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gpa3d.png&#39;) # add centroid size to qdata qdata$csz &lt;- Y.gpa$Csize # print updated qdata with centroid size knitr::kable(qdata, align = &quot;lccccc&quot;, caption = &quot;Modified attributes included in qdata.&quot;) Table 2.1: Modified attributes included in qdata. site type geo time comb csz 1-15-3-Pot3 Atkinson Farm Hodges Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 336.4793 1054 Belcher Mound Taylor Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 221.1933 1073 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 396.8419 121 Salt Lick Wilder Engraved south Late-Historic south, late historic 308.8975 132 Paul Mitchell Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 687.3149 142 Allen Plantation Hickory Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 810.0585 152 Smithport Landing Smithport Plain south Formative-Early south, formative early 222.3931 157 Smithport Landing Hickory Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 635.9682 16 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 718.4339 16sa37-121 Eleven Ton Bridge Wilder Engraved south Late-Historic south, late historic 305.4943 18 Pohler Coll Smithport Plain north Formative-Early north, formative early 624.6644 19-361 George C Davis Holly Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 652.1150 19-4020 George C Davis Holly Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 719.2440 2 Mustang Creek Mound Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 715.1674 20 Pohler Coll Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 487.5317 2007.18.02 Green UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 632.7158 2015-1 George C Davis Hickory Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 425.1642 2097-1 George C Davis Holly Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 593.4289 23 Pohler Coll Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 669.7663 24 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 418.6807 256 Belcher Mound Taylor Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 458.8372 267 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 463.8621 269 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 557.5507 27 Pohler Coll Smithport Plain north Formative-Early north, formative early 639.5040 271 Belcher Mound Taylor Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 477.0324 29 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 625.1986 30 Pohler Coll Maxey Noded Redware north Formative-Early north, formative early 571.6977 31-1-79 Poole Maxey Noded Redware north Formative-Early north, formative early 571.5949 31 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 620.5723 317 Belcher Mound UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 686.0103 325 Belcher Mound Wilder Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 550.6656 340 Belcher Mound UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 620.1775 361 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 628.7876 363 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 585.9939 404 Belcher Mound Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 504.5038 41sy25-2 S.

C. Adams and Collyer 2015; Michael L. Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes differ by group (geography and time), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (M. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). 2.4.1 Size and shape # size.geo fit.size &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ geo + time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape.geo fit.shape &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ geo + time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) 2.5 Test Hypothesis Hypothesis: Formative/Early and Late/Historic Caddo bottles found north and south of the shape boundary express unique patterns of shape change. 2.5.1 Procrustes ANOVA # ANOVA: do Caddo bottle sizes differ by geography and/or time? anova(fit.size) ## ## Analysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization ## Permutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals ## Number of permutations: 10000 ## Estimation method: Ordinary Least Squares ## Sums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I ## Effect sizes (Z) based on F distributions ## ## Df SS MS Rsq F Z Pr(&gt;F) ## geo 1 25282 25282 0.01231 1.3094 0.73333 0.2475 ## time 1 271285 271285 0.13210 14.0506 2.92981 0.0003 *** ## Residuals 91 1756998 19308 0.85558 ## Total 93 2053565 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Call: procD.lm(f1 = size ~ geo + time, iter = 9999, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE) # ANOVA: do Caddo bottle shapes differ by geography and/or time? anova(fit.shape) ## ## Analysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization ## Permutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals ## Number of permutations: 10000 ## Estimation method: Ordinary Least Squares ## Sums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I ## Effect sizes (Z) based on F distributions ## ## Df SS MS Rsq F Z Pr(&gt;F) ## geo 1 0.15087 0.150868 0.10486 12.527 3.9641 1e-04 *** ## time 1 0.19200 0.192001 0.13345 15.943 4.0840 1e-04 *** ## Residuals 91 1.09593 0.012043 0.76170 ## Total 93 1.43880 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Call: procD.lm(f1 = shape ~ geo + time, iter = 9999, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE) 2.5.2 Mean Shapes # subset landmark coordinates to produce mean shapes new.coords&lt;-coords.subset(A = Y.gpa$coords, group = qdata$comb) names(new.coords) ## [1] &quot;north, formative early&quot; &quot;north, late historic&quot; &quot;south, formative early&quot; ## [4] &quot;south, late historic&quot; # group shape means mean &lt;- lapply(new.coords, mshape) # plot mean shapes plot(mean$`north, formative early`) plot(mean$`north, late historic`) plot(mean$`south, formative early`) plot(mean$`south, late historic`) # comparison plots plotRefToTarget(mean$`north, formative early`, mean$`north, late historic`, method = c(&quot;points&quot;), mag = 1) plotRefToTarget(mean$`north, formative early`, mean$`south, formative early`, method = &quot;points&quot;, mag = 1) plotRefToTarget(mean$`north, formative early`, mean$`south, late historic`, method = &quot;points&quot;, mag = 1) plotRefToTarget(mean$`north, late historic`, mean$`south, formative early`, method = &quot;points&quot;, mag = 1) plotRefToTarget(mean$`north, late historic`, mean$`south, late historic`, method = &quot;points&quot;, mag = 1) plotRefToTarget(mean$`south, formative early`, mean$`south, late historic`, method = &quot;points&quot;, mag = 1) knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/comp.composite.jpg&#39;) 2.6 Trajectory analysis # trajectory analysis::shape TA &lt;- trajectory.analysis(fit.shape, groups = qdata$geo, traj.pts = qdata$time, print.progress = FALSE) # magnitude difference summary(TA, attribute = &quot;MD&quot;) ## ## Trajectory analysis ## ## 10000 permutations. ## ## Points projected onto trajectory PCs ## ## Trajectories: ## Trajectories hidden (use show.trajectories = TRUE to view) ## ## Observed path distances by group ## ## north south ## 0.09211959 0.09211959 ## ## Pairwise absolute differences in path distances, plus statistics ## d UCL (95%) Z Pr &gt; d ## north:south 8.326673e-17 1.457168e-16 0.5188623 0.26785 # plot TP &lt;- plot(TA, pch = as.numeric(qdata$geo), bg = as.numeric(qdata$time), cex = 0.9, col = &quot;gray&quot;) add.trajectories(TP, traj.pch = c(15, 19), start.bg = 1, end.bg = 2) knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/trajectory.jpg&#39;) References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
