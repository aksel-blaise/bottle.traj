Selden, Jr. 2021-02-11 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written using Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Diagnostic typeswhether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological (OBrien and Lyman 1999)are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations. Morphological differences between the northern and southern Caddo bottle shapes have been the topic of recent studies (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021b), and geographical (north-south) differences occur across the same shape boundary for Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) as well as Perdiz arrow points. The goal of this endeavour is to assess shape change through time for Caddo bottles found in the geographies of the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice, as defined in a recent exploratory network analysis (Selden Jr. 2021a). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/fig.map.jpg&#39;) (#fig:fig.map)Location of archaeological sites mentioned in the text. 0.1 Primary findings Caddo bottle size does not differ significantly by geography, but differs significantly by time Caddo bottle shape differs significantly by geography and time Patterns of bottle shape in the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice differ significantly 0.2 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma,the Material Sciences Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions, access, and space needed to generate 3D scans of Caddo bottles. Thanks also to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Michael J. Shott, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, B. Sunday Eiselt, Julian A. Sitters, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research programme, and the anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript. 0.3 Funding Development of the analytical work flow and production of 3D scans from the Turner and Webb collections was funded by a grant to the author (P14AP00138) from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training. Production of 3D scan data for Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was funded by a grant from the Texas Archeological Society, and collection of 3D scan data for previously repatriated Caddo bottles was funded by a grant from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. 0.4 Data management The data and analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/GH7VZ).
