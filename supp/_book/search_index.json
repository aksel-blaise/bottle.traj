Selden, Jr. 2021-02-24 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written using Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. 0.1 Basis of inquiry In a June 18, 1937 WPA interview with Lillian Cassaway, Sadie Bedokaa Caddo-Delaware woman who was raised wth the Caddoesstates that: Each [Caddo] clan had its own shape to make its pottery. One [Caddo] clan never thought of making anything the same pattern of another clan. You could tell who made the pottery by the shape (Cassaway 1937, 395). Diagnostic typeswhether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological (OBrien and Lyman 1999)are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations; however, the Caddo ceramic types are based upon decorative motifs, and not morphology (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Morphological differences between the northern and southern Caddo bottle shapes have been the topic of recent studies (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021b), where a shape boundary was posited. More recently, morphological differences were also found to occur across the same shape boundary for Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) and Perdiz arrow points. In the analyses of Caddo bottle morphology (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021b), vessels of the same decorative type were found to differ in morphology across a specific geographic range. It is not known whether the same Caddo maker that crafted a vessels shape also applied the decorative elements; however, if the maker is also assumed to be the decorator, then it may be the case that Caddo vessel shapes and decorative elements incorporate distinct cultural signals, perhaps akin to the autogenous and adherent signals proposed by Kubler (1962). The analysis builds directly upon those insights provided by Sadie Bedoka, adding a temporal component to assess whether (general) Caddo bottle shapes from the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice differ through time. A recent analysis of French trade axes successfully identified the morphological idiosyncracies of French blacksmiths, and a current study of Caddo ceramic incision morphology is extending the reach of morphological studies by asking if it may be possible to identify whether Caddo makers used a standard tool (or toolkit) to apply the diverse decorative motifs that adorn Caddo ceramics. In studies of ceramic morphology, an analysis of bilateral/object symmetry can yield useful insights related to design intent, provided it is assumed that the goal of the potter was to produce a symmetrical vessel. Within that framework, deviation from bilateral symmetry (fluctuating asymmetry) might serve as a useful measure of production stability, differential production practices, and/or skill. The landmarking protocol developed for this study incorporates the widest vessel profile, which can be revolved 360-degrees to render a fully-symmetrical 3D model of each vessel in the sample. That model can, in turn, be used to calculate the deviation from the 3D model (Selden Jr. 2017). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/asymmetry.jpg&#39;) (#fig:fig.asymmetry.x)Deviations from axial symmetry enlist the unique mesh of each bottle (a), then revolve sketch of the widest vessel profile identified in the GM study to produce a symmetrical surface model (b) that is built atop the mesh (c), and used to calculate deviations between the symmetrical surface model and the mesh (d). This exploratory study enlists a novel, and replicable, 3D landmarking protocol that provides a means of further parsing Caddo bottles into discrete components (i.e., rim, neck, body, and base). If the hypothesis is supported, subsequent analyses will be run to identify which morphological componentor suite of componentsare driving the pattern. The goal of this endeavour is to assess shape change through time for Caddo bottles found in the geographies of the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice, as defined in a recent exploratory network analysis (Selden Jr. 2021a). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/fig.map.jpg&#39;) (#fig:fig.map)Location of archaeological sites with Caddo bottles represented in the current sample. 0.2 Primary findings Caddo bottle size does not differ significantly by geography, but differs significantly by time Caddo bottle shape differs significantly by geography and time Caddo bottle shape trajectories differ significantly through time for the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice 0.3 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Material Sciences Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions, access, and space needed to generate 3D scans of Caddo bottles. Thanks also to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Michael J. Shott, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, B. Sunday Eiselt, Julian A. Sitters, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research programme, and the anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript. 0.4 Funding Development of the analytical work flow and production of 3D scans from the Turner and Webb collections was funded by a grant to the author (P14AP00138) from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training. Production of 3D scan data for Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was funded by a grant from the Texas Archeological Society, and collection of 3D scan data for previously repatriated Caddo bottles was funded by a grant from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. 0.5 Data management The data and analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/GH7VZ).
