Selden, Jr. 2021-02-21 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written using Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Diagnostic typeswhether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological (OBrien and Lyman 1999)are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations. Morphological differences between the northern and southern Caddo bottle shapes have been the topic of recent studies (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021b), and geographical (north-south) differences occur across the same shape boundary for Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) as well as Perdiz arrow points. The goal of this endeavour is to assess shape change through time for Caddo bottles found in the geographies of the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice, as defined in a recent exploratory network analysis (Selden Jr. 2021a). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/fig.map.jpg&#39;) (#fig:fig.map)Location of archaeological sites mentioned in the text. 0.1 Primary findings Caddo bottle size does not differ significantly by geography, but differs significantly by time Caddo bottle shape differs significantly by geography and time Caddo bottle shape trajectories differ significantly through time for the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice 0.2 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Material Sciences Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions, access, and space needed to generate 3D scans of Caddo bottles. Thanks also to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Michael J. Shott, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, B. Sunday Eiselt, Julian A. Sitters, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research programme, and the anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript. 0.3 Funding Development of the analytical work flow and production of 3D scans from the Turner and Webb collections was funded by a grant to the author (P14AP00138) from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training. Production of 3D scan data for Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was funded by a grant from the Texas Archeological Society, and collection of 3D scan data for previously repatriated Caddo bottles was funded by a grant from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. 0.4 Data management The data and analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/GH7VZ).

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). # gpa Y.gpa &lt;- gpagen(coords, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) # geomorph data frame gdf &lt;- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords, size = Y.gpa$Csize, geo = qdata$geo, time = qdata$time, comb = qdata$comb) # render 3d gpa plot #plot(Y.gpa) # gpa plot knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gpa3d.png&#39;) # add centroid size to qdata qdata$csz &lt;- Y.gpa$Csize # print updated qdata with centroid size knitr::kable(qdata, align = &quot;lccccc&quot;, caption = &quot;Modified attributes included in qdata.&quot;) Table 2.1: Modified attributes included in qdata. site type geo time comb csz 1-15-3-Pot3 Atkinson Farm Hodges Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 336.4793 1054 Belcher Mound Taylor Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 221.1933 1073 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 396.8419 121 Salt Lick Wilder Engraved south Late-Historic south, late historic 308.8975 132 Paul Mitchell Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 687.3149 142 Allen Plantation Hickory Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 810.0585 152 Smithport Landing Smithport Plain south Formative-Early south, formative early 222.3931 157 Smithport Landing Hickory Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 635.9682 16 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 718.4339 16sa37-121 Eleven Ton Bridge Wilder Engraved south Late-Historic south, late historic 305.4943 18 Pohler Coll Smithport Plain north Formative-Early north, formative early 624.6644 19-361 George C Davis Holly Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 652.1150 19-4020 George C Davis Holly Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 719.2440 2 Mustang Creek Mound Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 715.1674 20 Pohler Coll Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 487.5317 2007.18.02 Green UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 632.7158 2015-1 George C Davis Hickory Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 425.1642 2097-1 George C Davis Holly Fine Engraved south Formative-Early south, formative early 593.4289 23 Pohler Coll Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 669.7663 24 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 418.6807 256 Belcher Mound Taylor Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 458.8372 267 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 463.8621 269 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 557.5507 27 Pohler Coll Smithport Plain north Formative-Early north, formative early 639.5040 271 Belcher Mound Taylor Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 477.0324 29 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 625.1986 30 Pohler Coll Maxey Noded Redware north Formative-Early north, formative early 571.6977 31-1-79 Poole Maxey Noded Redware north Formative-Early north, formative early 571.5949 31 Pohler Coll UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 620.5723 317 Belcher Mound UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 686.0103 325 Belcher Mound Wilder Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 550.6656 340 Belcher Mound UID north Late-Historic north, late historic 620.1775 361 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 628.7876 363 Belcher Mound Belcher Engraved north Late-Historic north, late historic 585.9939 404 Belcher Mound Hickory Fine Engraved north Formative-Early north, formative early 504.5038 41sy25-2 S.

Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes differ by group (geography and time), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (M. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). 2.4.1 Size and shape # size fit.sz.geo &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ geo, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # size fit.sz.time &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape fit.sh.geo &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ geo, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape fit.sh.time &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # size.geo fit.size &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ geo * time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape.geo fit.shape &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ geo * time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) 2.5 Test Hypothesis Hypothesis: Formative/Early and Late/Historic Caddo bottles found north and south of the shape boundary express unique patterns of shape change. 2.5.1 Procrustes ANOVA # ANOVA: do Caddo bottle sizes differ by geo?

Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (M. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). 3.4.1 Hypothesis There is a difference in the symmetric shape of Caddo bottles by community of practice through time. # symmetric shape as a function of geography through time fit &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ geo * time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # asymmetric shape as a function of geography through time fit.asymm &lt;- procD.lm(ashape ~ geo * time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) 3.5 Procrustes ANOVA # ANOVA: do symmetric Caddo bottle shapes differ by geography through time? anova(fit) ## ## Analysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization ## Permutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals ## Number of permutations: 10000 ## Estimation method: Ordinary Least Squares ## Sums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I ## Effect sizes (Z) based on F distributions ## ## Df SS MS Rsq F Z Pr(&gt;F) ## geo 1 0.14552 0.145522 0.10600 13.4164 4.1132 1e-04 *** ## time 1 0.18208 0.182084 0.13263 16.7872 4.2203 1e-04 *** ## geo:time 1 0.05824 0.058243 0.04242 5.3697 2.6734 0.003 ** ## Residuals 91 0.98704 0.010847 0.71895 ## Total 94 1.37289 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Call: procD.lm(f1 = shape ~ geo * time, iter = 9999, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE) # ANOVA: do asymmetric Caddo bottle shapes differ by geography through time? anova(fit.asymm) ## ## Analysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization ## Permutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals ## Number of permutations: 10000 ## Estimation method: Ordinary Least Squares ## Sums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I ## Effect sizes (Z) based on F distributions ## ## Df SS MS Rsq F Z Pr(&gt;F) ## geo 1 0.001239 0.0012390 0.00931 0.8782 0.11474 0.4565 ## time 1 0.001870 0.0018697 0.01405 1.3253 0.74985 0.2297 ## geo:time 1 0.001594 0.0015937 0.01197 1.1296 0.48594 0.3163 ## Residuals 91 0.128383 0.0014108 0.96467 ## Total 94 0.133086 ## ## Call: procD.lm(f1 = ashape ~ geo * time, iter = 9999, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE) # end of code "],["references.html", "References", " References Adams, Dean C., and Michael L.
