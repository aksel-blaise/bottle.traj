Selden, Jr. 2021-02-10 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written in Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Diagnostic typeswhether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological (OBrien and Lyman 1999)are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations. Morphological differences between the northern and southern Caddo bottle shapes have been the topic of recent studies (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021b), and geographical (north-south) differences occur across the same shape boundary for Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) as well as Perdiz arrow points. The goal of this endeavour is to assess shape change through time for Caddo bottles found in the geographies of the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice, as defined in a recent exploratory network analysis (Selden Jr. 2021a). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/fig.map.jpg&#39;) (#fig:fig.map)Location of archaeological sites mentioned in the text. 0.1 Primary findings The size of Caddo bottles do not differ significantly by geography, but do differ significantly by time The shape of Caddo bottles differ significantly by geography and time Patterns of bottle shape in the northern and southern Caddo communities of practice differ significantly 0.2 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma,the Material Sciences Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions, access, and space needed to generate 3D scans of Caddo bottles.

LaSEC conducts the following procedure (Watanabe 2018, 45): As is typical for extracting shape data, perform a generalized Procrustes alignment (gpagen function in the geomorph package) on a coordinate dataset (argument coord.data) in 2-D or 3-D (argument n.dim) and record the resulting shape coordinates and centroid size. Here, the shape coordinates are projected onto tangent space because pairwise distances among corresponding datasets later in the analysis are based on Euclidean distances and most shape analyses in the biological literature are conducted in tangent space instead of Procrustes shape space. Subsample the same three randomly selected landmarks from all specimens. The subsampling begins with a subset of three landmarks because a minimum of three landmarks is required to define shape. Then, generate shape and centroid size data with generalized Procrustes superimposition on the subsampled data. Perform an Ordinary Procrustes Alignment (protest function in the vegan R package) on the subsampled data to minimize the pairwise distances between corresponding landmarks in the parent data through translation, rotation, and scaling of data in full shape space. As stated above, note that this procedure is different from the typical implementation of Procrustes alignment on coordinate data in 2-D or 3-D space. The function then records the sum of these squared distances as measure of fit (PSS) between the relative locations of data points in the parent and subsampled datasets. Equivalent procedure is conducted on centroid size data. Sample one additional, randomly chosen landmark and repeat step 3 until the entire set of landmarks in the parent dataset is sampled. The completion of this step represents one iteration of subsampling. Repeat steps 25 for specified number of iterations (iter argument). Create sampling curves by plotting the trajectory of fit (1PSS) against the number of landmarks sampled from each iteration for both shape and centroid size as gray lines. Then, plot the median fit value for each number of landmarks sampled on the same plot as a thick, dark line. Finally, output these sampling curves: LaSEC_SamplingCurve_Shape.pdf, LaSEC_SamplingCurve_Size.pdf. 2.1 Analysis of experimental sample # load package #devtools::install_github(&quot;akiopteryx/lambda&quot;) library(here) library(LaMBDA) source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./data&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) lmdata &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) lmdata &lt;- two.d.array(lmdata) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # analysis lasec(coord.data = lmdata, n.dim = 3, iter = 1000) Results demonstrate that nine landmarks are necessary to achieve a median fit value of 0.90, 13 to achieve a median fit value of 0.95, and 29 to achieve a fit value of 0.99. For centroid size, six landmarks were needed to achieve a median fit value of 0.99. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lasec.png&#39;) (#fig:fig.lasec.EX)Sampling curves from performing LaSEC on the dataset with respect to characterising shape variation. Each gray line indicates fit values from one iteration of subsampling. Thick, dark line denotes median fit value at each number of landmarks. LaSEC sampling curve for centroid size (left), and for shape (right). Results produced using the code above for this 3D dataset, using 1,000 iterations. Images converted to PNG following export. Results demonstrate saltation, meaning that some landmarks are critical for capturing shape information (Watanabe 2018). Dynamic as Caddo bottles may be, that variation might be captured with a configuration of landmarks that employed fewer semilandmarks.

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). # gpa Y.gpa &lt;- gpagen(coords, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) # output + consensus configuration coords Y.gpa ##

The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualised using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). # principal components analysis pca&lt;-gm.prcomp(Y.gpa$coords) summary(pca) ##

Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes differ by group (geography and time), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (M. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). 3.4.1 Size and shape # size fit.sz.geo &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ geo, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # size fit.sz.time &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape fit.sh.geo &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ geo, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape fit.sh.time &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # size.geo fit.size &lt;- procD.lm(size ~ geo * time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) # shape.geo fit.shape &lt;- procD.lm(shape ~ geo * time, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) 3.5 Test Hypothesis Hypothesis: Formative/Early and Late/Historic Caddo bottles found north and south of the shape boundary express discrete patterns of shape change. 3.5.1 Boxplot # attributes for boxplot csz &lt;- qdata$csz # centroid size comb &lt;- qdata$comb # comb + time # boxplot of Caddo bottle centroid size by comb (north/south) csz.comb &lt;- ggplot(qdata, aes(x = comb, y = csz, color = comb)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = &#39;y&#39;, stackdir = &#39;center&#39;, dotsize = 0.3) + scale_colour_manual(values = wes_palette(&quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &#39;North/South + Formative/Early or Late/Historic?&#39;, y = &#39;Centroid Size&#39;) # render plot csz.comb ## `stat_bindot()` using `bins = 30`.
